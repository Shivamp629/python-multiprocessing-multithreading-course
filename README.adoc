== Course Overview

This hands-on course demystifies how modern servers handle API requests using multiple cores, threads, and system-level operations. Through practical Python examples, you'll understand the journey of an HTTP request from network card to application response.

=== What You'll Learn

* How network packets travel from NIC to your application
* The role of file descriptors and sockets in networking
* User space vs kernel space operations and their performance impact
* Multithreading vs multiprocessing vs async I/O
* Thread management and synchronization primitives
* Real-world patterns for building high-performance servers

=== Prerequisites

* Basic Python knowledge
* Command line familiarity
* Basic understanding of HTTP/REST APIs
