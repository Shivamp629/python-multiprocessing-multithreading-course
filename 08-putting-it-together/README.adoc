toc::[]

== Overview

This final module brings together all the concepts we've learned to build a high-performance API server. We'll implement different server architectures and compare their performance characteristics, demonstrating how to choose the right approach for different workloads.

**Duration**: 3 minutes

== Learning Objectives

* Combine networking, threading, multiprocessing, and async concepts
* Build three server implementations: threaded, multiprocess, and async
* Understand trade-offs between different architectures
* Implement production-ready features: connection pooling, rate limiting, monitoring
* Measure and optimize performance

== Key Components

=== 1. Connection Management

- **Connection pooling**: Reuse connections
- **Keep-alive**: Persistent connections
- **Backpressure**: Handle overload gracefully

=== 2. Request Processing

- **Routing**: Efficient path matching
- **Middleware**: Pluggable processing pipeline
- **Error handling**: Graceful error responses

=== 3. Performance Features

- **Zero-copy**: Minimize data copying
- **Buffer management**: Efficient memory usage
- **Caching**: Reduce redundant work

=== 4. Monitoring & Observability

- **Metrics**: Request rate, latency, errors
- **Logging**: Structured logging
- **Health checks**: Liveness and readiness

== Production Checklist

âœ… **Graceful shutdown**: Clean connection closing

âœ… **Error recovery**: Handle failures gracefully

âœ… **Rate limiting**: Prevent abuse

âœ… **Access logging**: Audit trail

âœ… **Security headers**: CORS, CSP, etc.

âœ… **Connection limits**: Prevent resource exhaustion

âœ… **Timeout handling**: No hanging connections

âœ… **Metric collection**: Performance monitoring

== Quick Exercise

Build and test the servers:

[source,bash]
----
# 1. Run the high-performance server
python 01_http_server.py

# 2. In another terminal, run load tests
python 02_load_testing.py

# 3. Explore production features
python 03_production_features.py
----

== Key Takeaways

âœ… Choose architecture based on workload characteristics

âœ… Async excels for high-concurrency I/O workloads

âœ… Multiprocessing best for CPU-bound tasks

âœ… Threading good for moderate concurrency

âœ… Monitor and profile to identify bottlenecks

âœ… Production servers need robust error handling
