== Overview

This module explores the foundational concepts of network programming in Python, covering how data travels from the Network Interface Card (NIC) through the kernel to your application.

**Duration**: 4 minutes

== Learning Objectives

* Understand file descriptors and their role in I/O operations
* Learn how sockets work at the system level
* Explore the journey of network packets from NIC to application
* Understand the cost of system calls

== Key Concepts

=== File Descriptors

A file descriptor is a non-negative integer that uniquely identifies an open file or socket within a process. In Unix-like systems, everything is a file - including network connections.

[source,python]
----
# Example: File descriptors in action
import os
import socket

# Create a socket - this returns a file descriptor
sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
print(f"Socket file descriptor: {sock.fileno()}")

# Standard file descriptors
print(f"stdin: {sys.stdin.fileno()}")   # Usually 0
print(f"stdout: {sys.stdout.fileno()}")  # Usually 1
print(f"stderr: {sys.stderr.fileno()}")  # Usually 2
----

=== Network Interface Card (NIC)

The NIC is responsible for:

1. **Receiving packets**: Physical signals → Digital data
2. **DMA transfers**: Direct Memory Access bypasses CPU for efficiency
3. **Interrupt generation**: Notifies CPU of incoming data
4. **Checksum offloading**: Hardware-accelerated error checking

== Performance Insights

=== System Call Overhead

Each transition from user space to kernel space has a cost:

[cols="2,1,3", options="header"]
|===
|Operation |Typical Time |Impact

|System call overhead
|~100-300ns
|Context switch, privilege level change

|Data copy (1KB)
|~500ns
|Memory bandwidth limited

|Network RTT (local)
|~50μs
|Kernel processing + wire time
|===

=== Zero-Copy Techniques

Modern systems use techniques to avoid copying data:

1. **sendfile()**: Transfer data between file descriptors without copying through user space
2. **mmap()**: Map kernel buffers directly into user space
3. **io_uring**: New Linux API for asynchronous I/O with shared memory rings

== Quick Exercise

Run the examples in order:

[source,bash]
----
# 1. Explore socket and file descriptor basics
python 01_socket_basics.py

# 2. Monitor file descriptors in real-time
python 02_fd_monitor.py

# 3. Visualize packet journey simulation
python 03_packet_journey.py
----

== Key Takeaways

✅ File descriptors are the interface between user space and kernel resources

✅ Network data travels through multiple layers, each adding processing time

✅ System calls are expensive - batch operations when possible

✅ Modern NICs offload many operations to hardware for efficiency
