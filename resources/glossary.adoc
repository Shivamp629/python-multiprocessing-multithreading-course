= Glossary of Terms

== A

**Accept Queue**:: The queue of pending connections waiting to be accepted by the server.

**Async/Await**:: Python syntax for asynchronous programming using coroutines.

**Atomic Operation**:: An operation that completes in a single step without possibility of interruption.

== B

**Backlog**:: Maximum number of pending connections in the accept queue.

**Barrier**:: Synchronization primitive that blocks threads until all have reached a certain point.

**Buffer**:: Temporary storage area for data being transferred between locations.

== C

**Context Switch**:: The process of saving and restoring CPU state when switching between threads/processes.

**Coroutine**:: A function that can be paused and resumed, used in async programming.

**Copy-on-Write (COW)**:: Optimization where memory pages are shared until modified.

**Critical Section**:: Code that must be executed by only one thread at a time.

== D

**Deadlock**:: Situation where threads are blocked forever waiting for each other.

**DMA (Direct Memory Access)**:: Hardware feature allowing devices to access memory without CPU.

== E

**Event Loop**:: Core component that schedules and executes async tasks.

**Epoll**:: Linux system call for scalable I/O event notification.

== F

**File Descriptor**:: Integer that uniquely identifies an open file or socket.

**Fork**:: System call that creates a new process by copying the current one.

== G

**GIL (Global Interpreter Lock)**:: Mutex that protects Python objects from concurrent access.

**Green Thread**:: User-space thread managed by runtime rather than OS.

== I

**Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**:: Mechanisms for processes to communicate and share data.

**Interrupt**:: Signal to CPU that an event needs immediate attention.

== K

**Kernel Space**:: Protected memory area where the OS kernel executes.

**Keep-Alive**:: HTTP feature to reuse TCP connections for multiple requests.

== L

**Lock**:: Synchronization primitive ensuring mutual exclusion.

**Livelock**:: Threads actively trying to resolve conflict but making no progress.

== M

**Memory Mapping**:: Technique to map files or devices into process memory space.

**Mutex**:: Mutual exclusion lock, same as Lock.

== N

**NIC (Network Interface Card)**:: Hardware component for network communication.

**Non-blocking I/O**:: I/O operations that return immediately without waiting.

== P

**Page Fault**:: Exception when program accesses memory page not in RAM.

**Pipeline**:: Pattern where data flows through sequential processing stages.

**Process**:: Independent program execution with its own memory space.

== Q

**Queue**:: FIFO data structure for thread-safe communication.

== R

**Race Condition**:: Bug occurring when program behavior depends on timing.

**Ring Buffer**:: Circular buffer that wraps around when full.

**RLock**:: Reentrant lock that can be acquired multiple times by same thread.

== S

**Semaphore**:: Synchronization primitive controlling access to limited resources.

**Socket**:: Endpoint for network communication.

**Spawn**:: Method of creating new process with fresh interpreter.

**System Call**:: Request from user program to kernel for OS services.

== T

**Thread**:: Lightweight execution unit sharing process memory.

**Thread Local Storage (TLS)**:: Per-thread storage isolated from other threads.

**Throughput**:: Rate of successful message delivery (requests/second).

== U

**User Space**:: Memory area where user applications execute.

== V

**Virtual Memory**:: Memory management providing abstract address space.

== Z

**Zero-Copy**:: Techniques avoiding unnecessary data copying between memory areas.
